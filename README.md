10/10 points bucket list challenge. I chose to focus mine in New Orleans, Lousiana. This was one of my favorite trips i've ever been on and I chose to pick the attractions I thought were most memorable!
My app finished MVP, and 2 stretches. The stretch to show more info and the stretch to show distance from center city hall.
